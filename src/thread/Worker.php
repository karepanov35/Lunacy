/**
 * Specialized Worker class for PocketMine-MP-related use cases. It handles setting up autoloading and error handling.
 *
 * Workers are a special type of thread which execute tasks passed to them during their lifetime. Since creating a new
 * thread has a high resource cost, workers can be kept around and reused for lots of short-lived tasks.
 *
 * As a plugin developer, you'll rarely (if ever) actually need to use this class directly.
 * If you want to run tasks on other CPU cores, check out AsyncTask first.
